# Multigrid

Contact:Xiaojian Yang (1724925160@qq.com)

Multigrid algorithms are widely used for solving large-scale sparse linear systems, which are essential for many high-performanceworkloads. 
The symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SYMGS) method is often responsible for the performance bottleneck of MG.
MG-Opt uses a modified computational formulation to reduce computational operations and memory accesses in SYMGS.
In addition, it proposes a new asynchronous parallelization scheme to reduce the synchronization overhead in SYMGS parallelization.
These optimization techniques are combined with the HPCG benchmark and a linear solver for unstructured matrices to demonstrate their advantages.
