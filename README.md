# MG-Opt

Contact:Xiaojian Yang (1724925160@qq.com)

Multigrid algorithms are widely used for solving large-scale sparse linear systems, which are essential for many high-performanceworkloads. 
The symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SYMGS) method is often responsible for the performance bottleneck of MG.
MG-Opt uses a modified computational formulation to reduce computational operations and memory accesses in SYMGS.
In addition, it proposes a new asynchronous parallelization scheme to reduce the synchronization overhead in SYMGS parallelization.
These optimization techniques are combined with the HPCG benchmark and a linear solver for unstructured matrices to demonstrate their advantages.

**This work is continuing to be optimized. In some cases, the pre-processing overhead is higher for some techniques, and we are working to refine this.
So far, this project is only partially open source.
If you have any questions about this project, please contact me.**
